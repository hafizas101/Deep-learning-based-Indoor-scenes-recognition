# Deep-learning-based-Indoor-scenes-recognition
Indoor scenes is a huge dataset consisting of 67 different indoor scenes. The purpose of this project is to recognize these scenes using CNN networks. The dataset is available at https://mega.nz/#!bcYxgYaK!V9548RXRcbbh6Wc11L7g9EmHTMSqauqVUd21hELLeiA
The training code is training_code.ipynb. The model for which best test accuracy is obtained is 'trained_weights.h5' and 'trained_model.json'. The file 'load_trained_model.ipynb' loads the trained model into and evaluates it on test portion of the dataset.
